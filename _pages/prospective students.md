## General inquiries

For inquiries, please contact [Dr. Pin Shuai](/members/Pin_Shuai) with your **CV, unofficial transcripts and a one-page personal statement**. In your one-page personal statement, please address the following questions: 1) Why are you interested in joining our group? 2) What qualities make you a strong candidate? 3) What quantitative skills, such as programming and modeling, do you possess?

Given the volume of general inquiries I receive, regrettably, I may not be able to respond to all of them. If you are serious about joining our group, I kindly request that you carefully address the above questions in your personal statement and indicate how your background aligns with the nature of work undertaken in our group. For a comprehensive understanding of my past and current research endeavors, please checkout the [Publications](/publications) and [Projects](/projects) pages on our website. Notably, the research in our group spans diverse interdisciplinary areas, including surface and groundwater hydrology, biogeosciences, and engineering, necessitating proficiency in computational skills such as numerical modeling, programming, and data analysis. 

I particularly welcome students with a tech-savvy inclination, as the work often involves leveraging advanced technological tools. I believe your engagement in such aspects will contribute positively to our collaborative efforts.

## Other notes

- For PhD applicants without a MS degree, our department requires students to obtain a MS degree as the first step toward a PhD degree. 
- International students typically require proof of English proficiency such as TOEFL or IELTS.
- While the GRE is not mandatory for applications, students are encouraged to take the exam and provide their scores as supplementary information for scholarship consideration.
