Welcome to the Computational and Integrated Hydrology Group (CIHG), led by [Pin Shuai](/members/Pin_Shuai), at Utah State University! We are passionate about exploring the complex and dynamic hydrological system using novel techniques. Our research endeavors are driven by a commitment to advancing scientific knowledge, fostering innovation, and addressing pressing environmental challenges. 

Our research interests lie in the following areas: 1) understanding of the **hydrological, biogeochemical processes** occurring at the aquatic‐terrestrial interface under the impact of **groundwater and surface water interactions**; 2) quantifying the **flow and transport of heat, nutrients and contaminants from bedrock to canopy top in a watershed**, and feedbacks between hydrology, land use, and climate change; and 3) understanding the complex **human-water interactions**.  We apply a model‐data integrative approach which combines field, laboratory, and remote sensing techniques with numerical models leveraging the power of high‐performance computing to improve understanding of hydrological processes. We are strong advocates for **open source** and **reproducible** scientific research.

We are always looking for passionate and talented group members. See [Prospective students](/prospective_students) page for more information.
