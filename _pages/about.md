Welcome to the Computational and Integrated Hydrology Group (CIHG) at Utah State University! We are passionate about exploring the complex and dynamic hydrological system. Our research endeavors are driven by a commitment to advancing scientific knowledge, fostering innovation, and addressing pressing environmental challenges. Our research interests lie in two areas: 1) understanding of the hydrological, biogeochemical processes occurring at the aquatic‐terrestrial interface under the impact of groundwater and surface water interactions; and 2) quantifying the flow and transport of heat, nutrients and contaminants from bedrock to canopy top in a watershed, and feedbacks between hydrology, land use, and climate change. We apply a model‐data integrative approach which combines field, laboratory, and remote sensing techniques with numerical models leveraging the power of high‐performance computing to improve understanding of hydrological processes. 


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
