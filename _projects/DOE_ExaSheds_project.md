ExaSheds is a DOE funded project that aims to advance watershed system science using machine learning-assisted simulation. You can read about the detailed information [here](https://exasheds.org/about/).

The USU team was awarded a subcontract to develop integrated watershed hydro-thermal models for the Upper Neversink Watershed within the Delaware River Basin using the <a href="https://amanzi.github.io/ats/"> Advanced Terrestrial Simulator</a>. The developed watershed models will provide training data for ML-assisted inverse modeling which will be performed by the PNNL team. 

**Funding Agency**: 

<a href="hhttps://ess.science.energy.gov/"> Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)</a>

**USU Team**: 

Pin Shuai, Utah State University (PI)

**Duration**: 

2022-2023

**Total funding**: 

$60,000
