The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Utah State University (USU) is seeking a PhD student or post-doc to work on a project funded by the Department of Energy. This project will study permafrost hydrological and biogeochemical processes in cold-region watersheds by advancing the state-of-the-art numerical models. The student will apply a model-data integrative approach that combines field data collection and numerical models (i.e., process-based hydrologic models), leveraging the power of highâ€‘performance computing. The project aims to improve understanding of the permafrost flow and reactive transport processes across the hillslope-riparian zone and through river systems. The student will have the opportunity to conduct field work in Alaska and collaborate with researchers from the University of Texas Austin, University of Michigan, and Oakridge National Laboratory. This fully funded position (i.e., Research Assistantship) will remain open until filled. The student is expected to start in Fall 2024.

**Qualifications:**

MS/PhD degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering or other closely related fields (such as hydrology, geoscience, and environmental science) at the time the program begins.
Strong quantitative skills and prior experience in hydrologic modeling (e.g., process-based models) and programming (e.g., Python, R, etc.) are preferred.
Strong written and verbal communication skills.

**Application**

If interested, please send an email to Dr. Bethany Neilson (bethany.neilson@usu.edu) and Dr. Pin Shuai (pin.shuai@usu.edu) with your CV, unofficial transcripts, and a 1-page research statement that briefly discusses how your background aligns with the research project. 

Email a current curriculum vitae, unofficial transcripts, and a 1-page research statement that briefly discusses how your background aligns with the research project as soon as possible to the faculty contacts.
