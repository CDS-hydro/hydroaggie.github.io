We are looking for two post-doctoral scholars in subsurface hydrology starting in September 2024 or as soon as possible. 

---

The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Utah State University (USU) and the University of Alabama are seeking two post-doctoral scholars to work on a new project funded by the Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH). These positions are funded for 20 months with the possibility of extension based on satisfactory performance. The preferred start date is **September 2024**, but the positions will remain open until filled.

**Project Description:**

Groundwaterâ€™s contribution to streams in the form of low flows is critical to sustaining streamflow during prolonged dry periods. The primary objective of the project is to **improve the low flow predictions in the NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework through improved subsurface conceptualization and parameterization**. The two post-doctoral scholars will work independently and collaboratively on the following two topics:

1.	Develop a CONUS scale dataset of effective hydraulic properties (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) of the subsurface using Machine Learning approaches. *Contact: Dr. Pin Shuai (pin.shuai@usu.edu), Utah State University, Logan, UT* (Work onsite with potential to become hybrid). 
2.	Implement an existing groundwater module in selected land surface and hydrologic models (e.g., Noah-MP, CFE, etc.) and test their performance in predicting low flows. *Contact: Dr. Mukesh Kumar (mkumar4@eng.ua.edu), The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL* (Work onsite with potential to become hybrid). 

**Qualifications:**

- PhD degree in Earth Science (such as hydrology, hydrogeology, geoscience, and environmental science) or other related engineering field (e.g., Civil and Environmental Engineering) at the time the program begins.
- Knowledge of fundamental hydrological processes in the subsurface.
- Expertise in Big Data, machine learning, and/or hydrologic modeling.
- Strong programming skills (e.g., Python and R).
- Strong written and verbal communication skills.
- U.S. work eligibility is required; non-U.S. scholars must have or be able to obtain a visa.

**To Apply:**

Email your **CV, names and contact information for three references, and a Cover Letter** to the contact person listed under each topic. In your cover letter, please briefly explain how your background aligns with the project. Applications will be reviewed immediately and will continue until the positions are filled. Candidates who are not contacted within 3 months from their application dates may consider their applications unsuccessful.

**Compensation:**

The annual salary ranges from $50,000 to $60,000, depending on experience and work site, in addition to employee benefits and health insurance. Inquire for details.
