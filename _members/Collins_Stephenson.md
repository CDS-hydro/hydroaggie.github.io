Collins is a MS student working on the effect of canal seepage on subsurface hydrological and thermal processes in Northern Utah. He is interested in the interaction between surface water and groundwater and how it affects the thermal regime of the subsurface. He is also interested in the use of numerical models to simulate these processes.
