I am a PhD student in the Department of Civil Engineering and Environmental Engineering at Utah State University and Utah Water Research Lab. My research focuses on advancing integrated hydrological models to study the impact of climate, land use, and landcover change on watershed hydrological and biogeochemical processes.

Prior to join USU, I was a Research Assistant at the American University of Beirut fro 2 years. 

## Short Bio

I received my B.S. and M.S. in Geology and Hydrogeology from the Lebanese University, Lebanon, in 2017 and 2020, respectively. I started pursuing my doctoral degree at USU in 2022
