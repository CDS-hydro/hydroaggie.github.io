Pin Shuai is currently an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://engineering.usu.edu/directory/cee/faculty/shuai-pin"> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering</a> at Utah State University and Utah Water Research Laboratory. 

Prior to joining USU, Pin worked as a post-doc and then as a staff scientist at Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL). At PNNL, Pin has worked on the SBR-SFA project titled <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/river-corridor"> “River Corridor Hydrobiogeochemistry Science Focus Area”</a>, with a focus on reach- and watershed- scale river corridor modeling. He aims to understand the dominant factors that control the dynamic exchange between river and aquifers and their implications on contaminant mobilization, biogeochemical and ecological processes in the Columbia River Basin under the impact of climate change and disturbances (e.g., wildfire). Additionally, Pin has been working on the <a href="https://exasheds.org"> ExaSheds</a> project to advance watershed system science using machine learning for data-intensive simulation.

During his PhD, he has focused on groundwater-surface water interactions under dynamic river flow conditions and their implications on nutrient and contaminant transport and transformation in the hyporheic zone adjacent to riverbanks. He has used both numerical models and field methods to study nitrate cycling in a dam regulated river in Texas as well as arsenic mobilization in the aquifer under tidal influence in Bangladesh.

In his spare time, Pin enjoys hiking, camping, skiing, and spending time with his family.

## Short Bio

Pin received his PhD in geology with focus on hydrogeology from Texas A&M University (USA) in 2017, and his MS and BS in water resources engineering from Wuhan University (China) in 2013 and 2011, respectively.
