I am a PhD student at Utah Water Research Laboratory, Utah State University. My research focuses on water management modeling and working on the USGS-funded [CIROH project](/projects/CIROH_hydrofabric) to extend the current hydrofabric by incorporating the water management infrastructure for water allocation purposes.

## Short Bio

I received my B.S. degree in Civil Engineering from Zanjan University, Iran, and my M.S. degree in Water Resources Engineering from Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran. I started pursuing my doctoral degree at USU in 2023.
